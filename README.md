### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work with:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
- [Frappe Framework](https://frappeframework.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com)

### My Open Source Contributions:


#### Firebase Extensions

You can use the following extensions if you want to:

- [firebase-logsnag-extension](https://github.com/nikkothari22/firebase-logsnag-extension): [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com) + [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) to send events to LogSnag on a Firestore trigger.
- [firebase-slack-extension](https://github.com/nikkothari22/firebase-slack-extension): [Slack](https://slack.com) + [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) to send messages on a Slack channel via Firestore.
- [firebase-twilio-verify-extension](https://github.com/nikkothari22/firebase-twilio-verify-extension): [Twilio Verify](https://www.twilio.com/verify) + [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions) extension to send and verify one-time codes via text/call/email.


#### Frappe Framework

- [frappe-js-sdk](https://github.com/nikkothari22/frappe-js-sdk): A Typescript/Javascript library to interact with your [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) backend. Can be used on all Javascript frameworks.
- [frappe-react-sdk](https://github.com/nikkothari22/frappe-react-sdk): React hooks to make it dead simple to interact with your [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) backend. Supports advanced features like Search with debouncing and realtime listeners.

I also contribute to Frappe framework occasionally - fixing minor bugs, building small features and updating documentation when I can.

I current work at [My Asset Buddy](https://myassetbuddy.in/) as the CTO - we're building beautiful software to manage industrial assets. 

I was also the Head of Product (and co-founder) of a startup called [Opportune](https://opportune.co.in). I helped build the product - which was an iOS and Android app built using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com), [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

### ðŸš€  Other research work you might be interested in (or could help me with):

- [Replicache](https://replicache.dev) + [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com): I am a big fan of [Linear](https://linear.app) and how they use real-time sync everywhere to make great user experiences. Having used Firestore for a lot of my projects, I am spoilt for real-time sync as well - makes development super easy. I am currently researching how we can use Replicache with Frappe - basically perform optimistic updates on the frontend and then manage the sync/merge on the backend.
- Credit Card Statement analyzer: I hate doing taxes - mainly because I have to convert all my CC PDF statements to Excel to analyse my spends. Pretty tedious process. I am currently working on a [Frappe](https://frappeframework.com) app that can analyse spends on PDF statements automatically (Will probably be using Tabula or some other OS library to do so)
